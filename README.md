## Contributing

Please don't write changes directly to master. Rather, make contributions with a pull request, so that teams can cross check changes to the tool and ensure cross-compatability.

Also, feel free to add to the current [process documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NYZhCdwTKY2kFLwW_qWAeGNOfnEI22AR-mBWP8H00zY/edit#heading=h.yutosj67sb9r). If you'd like to add new doc's, please link to them in the existing docs and in this README as well.

## Issues

If you have an issue that you can't fix with a PR, submit them as bugs. Feel free to solve existing bugs as well if you have the time ;)
